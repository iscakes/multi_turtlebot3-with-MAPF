Environment construction and configuration:
  Install the corresponding ROS；

Other library installation:
sudo apt install ros-<distro>-costmap-2d
sudo apt install ros-<distro>-naviagtion
sudo apt install ros-<distro>-costmap-converter
sudo apt install ros-<distro>-mbf-costmap-core
sudo apt install ros-<distro>-libg2o
sudo apt install ros-<distro>-tf2-eigen

Use and start:
roslaunch turtlebot3_navigation multi_turtlebot3_navigation.launch
All world storage addresses:
/home/wlm/cbs-new/src/turtlebot3_simulations/turtlebot3_gazebo/worlds
All maps are stored at:
/home/wlm/cbs-new/src/turtlebot3/turtlebot3_navigation/maps

Test cases;
About the factory map:factory_cropped.pgm  factory world：output311.world(This scene determines that the lower left corner is the origin 0.0)
Small scene：map1.pgm  Small scene world：cbs.world

how to use:
Replace the required world and map. You can first open the world through gazebo to see if the coordinates are consistent. The map coordinates are determined by the factory_cropped.yaml file. RG371.building.yaml is the original factory road network map, and 0.yaml is the factory road network map generated by traffic edditor.

About installing traffic_edditor:
Mainly because after changing to ROS1, the package version no longer matches, and the proj-7.2.1 package should be used
